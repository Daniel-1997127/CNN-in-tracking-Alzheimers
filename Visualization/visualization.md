Each of the three videos are visualization of 3D activation map of the trained Variational Autoencoder on 3 different MRI. This shows what features our model look at while making confidently correct decisions.

1. healthy to healthy - the person was healthy when the MRI was taken and remained healthy after 6 months. Our VAE correctly predicted that the person will remain healthy with 97% confidence.

2. healthy to diseased - the person was healthy when the MRI was taken, but got diseased after 6 months. Our VAE model correctly predicted that the person will get diseased with 91% confidence.

3. diseased to diseased - the person was diseased when the MRI was taken and made progression in 6 months. Our VAE model correctly predicted that the patient will remain diseased with 99% confidence.
