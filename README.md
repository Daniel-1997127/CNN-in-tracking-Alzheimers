***Qualitative Analysis***

* Which part of the brain some of the best peforming models look at?

  * When a healthy person got the disease:

The person was healthy when the MRI was taken, but got diseased after 6 months. Our VAE model correctly predicted that the person will get diseased with 91% confidence.

(For more details look into the *Visualization* folder. *Visualization* folder contains the code and visualzation videos for the visualization of activation maps shown in the qualitative results.)

*Note : Look up the branch vae.*

*P.S.: I'll clean this repository and upload the trained models *soon*. May be releasing the code will help me procrastinate procrastination!*
