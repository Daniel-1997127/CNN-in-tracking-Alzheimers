### Code for the *MICCAI 2019* paper *"Early Prediction of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Progression Using Variational Autoencoders"*

Paper Link: https://rdcu.be/bT8Yt

Note : Look up the branch vae.

*Visualization* folder contains the code and visualzation videos for the visualization of activation maps shown in the qualitative results.

P.S.: I'll clean this repository and upload the trained models *soon*. May be releasing the code will help me procrastinate procrastination!
